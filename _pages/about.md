I am a PhD student in Computational Psychiatry in the School of Informatics at the University of Edinburgh supervised by [Peggy Seri√®s](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/pseries/). 

In my research, I study differences in human behaviour and decision-making caused by anxiety disorders. To do so, I use a variety of computational cognitive modelling techniques including Bayesian analysis, reinforcement learning, prospect theory and diffusion models.

Prior to my PhD, I graduated with a Master of Science in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Edinburgh and I worked as a Data Scientist for two years, focusing on on-device models for Computer Vision.
